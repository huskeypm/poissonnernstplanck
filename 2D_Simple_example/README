This is the simple script I use to compare against COMSOL

The Domain is a 2D 40nm X 40nm square

The system only contains K+ and Cl-

To run the test 
1) compile the geo file : gmsh -2 test.geo ; dolfin-convert test.msh test.xml
2) change the path of test.xml in test.py: meshfile="/path_to_test.xml"
3) run the script:  "python test.py 100 -0.02" where "100" means [KCl] = 100 mM, "-0.02" means surface charge density at the bottom boarder sigma = -0.02 C/m^2
