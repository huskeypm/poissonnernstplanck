This is the simple script I use to compare against COMSOL

The Domain is a 2D 40nm X 40nm square

The system only contains K+ and Cl-

To run the test 
1) compile the geo file : gmsh -2 test.geo ; dolfin-convert test.msh test.xml
2) change the path of test.xml in test.py: meshfile="/path_to_test.xml"
3) run the script:  "python test.py 100 -0.02" where "100" means [KCl] = 100 mM, "-0.02" means surface charge density at the bottom boarder sigma = -0.02 C/m^2

Instrction of calculating effective diffusion constant:
1) After runing the test.py, you should get 5 pvd files ( use "ls -al *pvd" command to check)
2) These pvd files all can be loaded into Paraview (open Paraview --> File --> Open --> select pvd file -- click "Apply" or the eys sign to see result )
3) To calculate effective diffusion constant of K+, first load "ck_flux.pvd" into Paraview:
a) go to "Filters" --> "Data Analysis" --> "Plot Over Line" 
b) at the left panel of Paraview, fill in the coordinations of the line. Point1(2e-8,0,0) Point2(2e-8,4e-8,0), then you will get a line at the middile of the domain
c) click "Apply", go to the "Series Parameters", uncheck everything but "f-131_X", this will give you a graph of K+ flux in the x direction along the line you defined.
d) based on the graph, calculate the average K+ flux in the X direction: Jk, then effective diffusion constant is Deff = Jk*length/ck0
